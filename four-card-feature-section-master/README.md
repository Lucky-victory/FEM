## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i learnt how to use CSS flexbox to position elements in a grid-like pattern.



```html
<div class="cards-container-inner"> this div is my favourite because it did the layout trick.
</div>
```


### Continued development

Positioning the middle cards was the toughest part of this challenge, i would focus more on being about recreate similar layouts using CSS Flexbox.
